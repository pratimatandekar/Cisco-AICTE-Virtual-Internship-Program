# Campus Cyber Security Enhancement Project - Cisco AICTE Virtual Internship Program 2025
# Overview
This repository contains the necessary files and documentation for the Campus Cyber Security Enhancement Project conducted as part of the Cisco Cyber Security Industry Problem Statement for the Cisco AICTE Virtual Internship Program 2024. The project focuses on analyzing and enhancing the cyber security measures in place at the Manipal Institute of Technology campus network.
# Project Components
# 1. Network Analysis and Mapping
- **Objective** :  Analyze the existing campus network to identify the current security controls, including intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and authentication mechanisms.
- **Tools Used**: Cisco Packet Tracer for network topology visualization and mapping.
# 2. Attack Surface Mapping
- **Objective**:  Conduct a comprehensive attack surface mapping to identify potential vulnerabilities and propose effective countermeasures.
- **Details**: The analysis includes identifying open ports, weak passwords, and outdated firmware, and proposes upgrades to encryption protocols and firewall configurations.
# 3. Hybrid Working Environment
- **Objective**: Design and architect a secure hybrid working environment for faculty and students that ensures secure access both on-campus and remotely.
- **Solutions Proposed**: Implementation of VPNs, Network Access Control (NAC), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB).
# 4. Content Access Restriction
- **Objective**: Develop a network solution that restricts access to non-educational websites and ensures that only approved web content is accessible by students.
- **Technology Used** : Deployment of Cisco Umbrella for DNS filtering and Cisco Firepower for enhanced firewall protection.
